<p>Well, February 23 is 3 weeks away.  We are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Gabby.  Leslie is now seeing the doctor once a week and had a good checkup today.  He says Gabby should be between 7 and 7 and a half pounds at delivery.  Below is one of the ultrasound pictures from December 18.  We're excited to see how much she does or doesn't look like the picture!</p>
