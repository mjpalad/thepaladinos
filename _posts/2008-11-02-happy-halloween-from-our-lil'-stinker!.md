<p>This year Gabby was a skunk.  Yes, she'll probably hate us for it someday but we decided to have fun with it while we can.  There will be plenty of princess costumes in our future.  She went trick-or-treating for the first time with some of our friends and their two girls.  She loved it and I'm afraid could have gone all night if we had let her.    </p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0195.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DSC_0195" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0195_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="178"/></a> </p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0182.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DSC_0182" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0182_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="178"/></a> </p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0228.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DSC_0228" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0228_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="178"/></a></p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0169.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DSC_0169" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0169_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="178"/></a> </p> <p><em>The costume didn't keep her from her yard work duties.</em> <a href="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0178.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DSC_0178" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0178_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="178"/></a> </p> <p><em>Or playing on the swing.</em><a href="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0206.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DSC_0206" border="0" height="236" src="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0206_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="353"/></a> </p> <p><em>Look out...there are dangerous forest creatures out there.     <br/>Gabby with friends Grayson (monkey) and Logan (bear).</em><a href="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0211.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DSC_0211" border="0" height="236" src="/assets/images/2008-11-02-DSC_0211_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="353"/></a></p>
