Today we had pictures made with Mika Beth Edwards.  She's posted some of them on her web page at <a href="http://mikabeth.typepad.com/mika_beths_blog/2007/11/beautiful-gabby.html" target="_blank">http://mikabeth.typepad.com/mika_beths_blog/2007/11/beautiful-gabby.html</a>.  They turned out great and we can't wait to get to see all the proofs.
