<p> Last week we decided to try potty training with Gabby.&#160; We started on Monday by taking her to sit on her potty chair every 30 minutes to an hour.&#160; She was rewarded for sitting with a gummy bear and a small sticker on her potty chart.&#160; If she went to the bathroom she would get M &amp; M's and a big sticker on her potty chart.&#160; By Tuesday evening we had our first exciting success with a few more to follow in the days to come.&#160; But sadly by Saturday the newness had worn off and she refused and still refuses to sit on the potty.&#160; So we're back to diapers.&#160; It really wasn't quite as bad as I thought it would be though and we'll give it a try in a couple of months.&#160; She was a little confused about how to make the potty come out so I don't think she was really ready anyway.&#160; So I guess we'll have to figure out another way to get rid of those M&amp;M's.&#160; :)&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby also started MDO last Thursday at her new school.&#160; She has done so well!&#160; She just walks right in ready to play and learn and hasn't cried a bit.&#160; Whew!&#160; That's quite a change from our experiences last year so I'm very relieved.&#160; We have been going to church at Pinnacle Hills and she does just as well in her class there.&#160; She's such a big girl!&#160; We really like Pinnacle Hills and will probably make that our church home.&#160; We have even put Peter Michael in the nursery the last two Sunday's and he does great.&#160; He sleeps most of the time I think.&#160; That's quite a change from how we felt with Gabby who we didn't leave until she was at least 4 months.&#160; But he's pretty laid back so we felt he could handle it.&#160; Not to mention that he's probably as big as a 4 month old so he's just not as fragile.</p>  <p>This info is a little old but I'll put it down anyway so we can look back and remember.&#160; At his 9 week appointment he weighed 14.8 lbs and was in the 95th percentile for weight and height.&#160; He's just started wearing 3-6 month clothing and is in a #3 diaper.&#160; Gabby is in a #6 diaper if that puts his size into perspective for you.&#160; Apparently there's some weird big gene that we have passed on to both of our kids.&#160; Don't get me wrong though, we are very blessed to have big, healthy children.</p>  <p>Peter Michael is still doing about one feeding a night usually around 3 or 3:30 and then up again by 6 or 6:30.&#160; It varies still though so sometimes it's up twice a night or earlier than 6.&#160; I would still love a solid night of sleep but it could definitely be much worse.&#160; </p>  <p>Michael's job is going well.&#160; He has started a new position at Rockfish Labs which is a new division that his company just started.&#160; It will be him and one other developer who's job is to think up and implement new products and ideas.&#160; That's right up Michael's alley so he's very excited. </p>  <p><em>We had a little dirty diaper situation a few weeks ago when we were eating out with friends at Copelands.&#160; This is what Gabby ended up wearing during dinner with a blanket wrapped around her waist which doesn't stay on well for a 2.5 year old.&#160;&#160; How cool are we?!</em>    <br /><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/BusyDays_E5A2/DSC_0003.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-top: 0px;
