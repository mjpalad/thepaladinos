What is Gabby up to now?  Let's see....she has become an excellent walker and only crawls when she's very mad.  She does have a little bit of a temper and likes to get her way but I guess it's good that she knows what she wants.  She can say "Hi" and loves to follow it with "Hi Dada".  Dada is one of her favorite words now.  Ellie always barks when Michael comes home from work so now every time Ellie barks throughout the day Gabby looks at Mommy and whispers "Dada".  She loves to play in her crib and actually begs to get in it and she also loves playing on the other beds in the house.  She will lean back against the pillows and start her monologue which she does quite often.  She is definitely going to be a "gabby" girl and loves to talk with her hands.  She can eat just about anything if she so chooses which right now she's on a little bit of a picky kick.  She likes just about anything though if it comes off Mommy or Daddy's plates.  She's around 24 to 25 lbs and as you can see by one of the below pictures she has the sweetest curls in her hair.  It really comes out on humid days or when her hair is wet.  She's a very fun girl and still keeps us very entertained.<br/>
