What is Gabby up to now?&nbsp; Let&#39;s see....she has become an excellent walker and only crawls when she&#39;s very mad.&nbsp; She does have a little bit of a temper and likes to get her way but I guess it&#39;s good that she knows what she wants.&nbsp; She can say&nbsp;&quot;Hi&quot; and loves to follow it with &quot;Hi Dada&quot;.&nbsp; Dada is one of her favorite words now.&nbsp; Ellie always barks when Michael comes home from work so now every time Ellie barks throughout the day Gabby looks at Mommy and whispers &quot;Dada&quot;.&nbsp; She loves to play in her crib and actually begs to get in it&nbsp;and she also loves playing on the other beds in the house.&nbsp; She will lean back against the pillows and start her monologue which she does quite often.&nbsp; She is definitely going to be a &quot;gabby&quot; girl and loves to talk with her hands.&nbsp; She can eat just about anything if she so chooses&nbsp;which right now she&#39;s on&nbsp;a little bit of a picky kick.&nbsp; She likes just about anything though if it comes off Mommy or Daddy&#39;s plates.&nbsp; She&#39;s around 24 to 25 lbs and as you can see by one of the below pictures she has the sweetest curls in her hair.&nbsp; It really comes out on humid days or when her hair is wet.&nbsp; She&#39;s a very fun girl and still keeps us very entertained.<br />
