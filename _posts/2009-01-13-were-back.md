<p>You're all probably wondering if Gabby has started college now since it's been so long since we last updated the blog.&nbsp; It's been a very long December but things seem to be slowing down now.&nbsp; Michael and I started out the month celebrating our 6th Anniversary in Branson.&nbsp; It was a wonderful trip and I wish we were there relaxing now.&nbsp; The rest of the month included several Christmas's with family and traveling here and there.&nbsp; Most of the pictures below are not from Christmas because I'm lazy and don't feel like downloading them from the camera.&nbsp; </p> <p>Gabby has gotten even more talkative and can say just about anything.&nbsp; It's just understanding her that's hard now.&nbsp; She has very specific ideas about what she wants to do every day and doesn't mind letting you know.&nbsp; She usually likes being the center of attention but takes about 30 minutes to warm up to people.&nbsp; She can have a bit of a temper when she doesn't get her way but also gives the best hugs and kisses and can be such a sweet, affectionate girl.&nbsp; </p> <p><em>Silver Dollar City</em><br><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/WereBack_12F48/P1030487.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px;
