<p>Gabby had her first Dr.'s appt. today.  The jaundice is almost gone and she is starting to gain back weight.  She weighed 7 lbs 6 oz in the hospital, and after losing almost a pound in the first few days, she is now at 6 lbs 12 oz.  Feeding has been going much better and we're finally starting to get a feel for what works and doesn't work.  </p>
