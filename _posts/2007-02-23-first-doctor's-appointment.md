<p>Gabby had her first Dr.'s appt. today.  The jaundice is almost gone and she is starting to gain back weight.  She weighed 7 lbs 6 oz in the hospital, and after losing almost a pound in the first few days, she is now at 6 lbs 12 oz.  Feeding has been going much better and we're finally starting to get a feel for what works and doesn't work.  </p> <p><img alt="" height="263" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2007-02-23-P1000273Sepia(Custom).jpg" width="350"/></p> <p><img alt="" height="263" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2007-02-23-P1000264(Custom).JPG" width="350"/></p><br/><embed height="389" src="http://s170.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid170.photobucket.com/albums/u252/mjpalad/74600134.flv" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="430" wmode="transparent"/>
