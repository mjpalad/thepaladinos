We have so much to update everyone on so here goes.&nbsp; A couple of weekends ago Gabby had her first haircut.&nbsp; We took her to my stylist and Gabby did so good.&nbsp; She liked being one of the girls at the salon and showed off a little for the ladies.&nbsp; The haircut only took about 2 minutes and we turned on a video for her so it went pretty well.&nbsp; Don&#39;t worry, there are still plenty of curls left!&nbsp; We just had her little rat tail snipped off.&nbsp;

A couple of Wednesdays ago Gabby went swimming for the first time in a big pool.&nbsp; Our youth group rented out the local pool and we went to hang out.&nbsp; It took her a few seconds to warm up but after that we couldn&#39;t keep her out of the water.&nbsp; She just naturally flipped over to her little stomach and looked like she was swimming.&nbsp; Sorry guys no pictures but I did take some pics today in her little pool.&nbsp; She loves it even more after her big swimming adventure.&nbsp; So, we&#39;ll definitely have to watch the Olympics with her this year so she has a goal for the future.&nbsp;

This weekend we went to Berryville.&nbsp; We went to Uncle Rob and Aunt Jacque&#39;s house Friday night to watch fireworks.&nbsp; Gabby was in awe of them but not a huge fan.&nbsp; She didn&#39;t cry but she didn&#39;t really enjoy them even though she couldn&#39;t stop looking.&nbsp; She was of course up very late to watch the fireworks and turned into a crazy girl!&nbsp; She couldn&#39;t stay still and had such a good time.&nbsp; Amazingly she stayed in a good mood for being so over the top exhausted.&nbsp; Saturday we went to see Mimi and Papa&nbsp;where they were camping at Roaring River.&nbsp; Gabby wasn&#39;t feeling extremely social but she did get in the water and loved it!&nbsp;&nbsp;She had no fear and splashed and walked as long as daddy could stand it.&nbsp; The water was ice cold and pretty much numbed you immediately but it didn&#39;t bother&nbsp;our little fish&nbsp;at all.

As far as other updates, she is getting even more vocal.&nbsp; Her&nbsp;&quot;words&quot; are getting more pronounced and as of Sunday she now walks around&nbsp;saying/yelling &quot;no, no, no&quot;.&nbsp; I guess she hears that a lot.&nbsp; It also sounds like she is saying&nbsp;little phrases sometimes like &quot;me mama&quot; and &quot;me thirsty&quot;.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just how it sounds but you never know.&nbsp; She is very smart after all.&nbsp; She gets on these little kicks&nbsp;where she has very very busy hands and we absolutely can&#39;t keep up with them.&nbsp; While&nbsp;we&#39;re grabbing something away from her she already has something else in her little&nbsp;hand.&nbsp; She is so much fun and will be keeping Michael and I very young or making us very old.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re&nbsp;not sure which yet.&nbsp;
