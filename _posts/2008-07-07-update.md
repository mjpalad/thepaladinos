We have so much to update everyone on so here goes.  A couple of weekends ago Gabby had her first haircut.  We took her to my stylist and Gabby did so good.  She liked being one of the girls at the salon and showed off a little for the ladies.  The haircut only took about 2 minutes and we turned on a video for her so it went pretty well.  Don't worry, there are still plenty of curls left!  We just had her little rat tail snipped off.

A couple of Wednesdays ago Gabby went swimming for the first time in a big pool.  Our youth group rented out the local pool and we went to hang out.  It took her a few seconds to warm up but after that we couldn't keep her out of the water.  She just naturally flipped over to her little stomach and looked like she was swimming.  Sorry guys no pictures but I did take some pics today in her little pool.  She loves it even more after her big swimming adventure.  So, we'll definitely have to watch the Olympics with her this year so she has a goal for the future.

This weekend we went to Berryville.  We went to Uncle Rob and Aunt Jacque's house Friday night to watch fireworks.  Gabby was in awe of them but not a huge fan.  She didn't cry but she didn't really enjoy them even though she couldn't stop looking.  She was of course up very late to watch the fireworks and turned into a crazy girl!  She couldn't stay still and had such a good time.  Amazingly she stayed in a good mood for being so over the top exhausted.  Saturday we went to see Mimi and Papa where they were camping at Roaring River.  Gabby wasn't feeling extremely social but she did get in the water and loved it!  She had no fear and splashed and walked as long as daddy could stand it.  The water was ice cold and pretty much numbed you immediately but it didn't bother our little fish at all.

As far as other updates, she is getting even more vocal.  Her "words" are getting more pronounced and as of Sunday she now walks around saying/yelling "no, no, no".  I guess she hears that a lot.  It also sounds like she is saying little phrases sometimes like "me mama" and "me thirsty".  I'm sure that's just how it sounds but you never know.  She is very smart after all.  She gets on these little kicks where she has very very busy hands and we absolutely can't keep up with them.  While we're grabbing something away from her she already has something else in her little hand.  She is so much fun and will be keeping Michael and I very young or making us very old.  We're not sure which yet.
