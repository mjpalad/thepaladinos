<p>It’s hard to believe that 10 years ago today I became Mrs. Leslie Paladino.&#160; These have been the best years of my life and I so look forward to the next 50+ with my sweet, loving Michael.&#160; God could not have blessed me with a more perfect man and I am so thankful for His wisdom and grace that brought us together.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>Since our blog doesn’t go back that far I’ll reminisce a little about our relationship.&#160; We met sophomore year at the U of A in an Accounting II group.&#160; We were just friends and parted ways with an occasional hello in the hallway.&#160; Senior year we were thrown together again in a class called Death and Dying (yes, that’s seriously what it was about).&#160; His was the only familiar face in the class of 200 so we gratefully sat together for the semester and became friends.&#160; Our last semester we slowly started flirting and hanging out more.&#160; It was our friend, Michelle, who finally brought us together when she asked “so, do you think there could be some interest there?”&#160; The answer from both of us was yes and a few weeks later we were officially dating.&#160; Michael actually thought we were dating for 2 weeks before our first official date but I kindly corrected him on that misconception.&#160; Just for the record, when you start out as friends you have to make a distinction between hanging out and dating.&#160; I’m not sure when it happened for him but I fell in love soon after when we took a class trip to Belize.&#160; I remember telling one of my friends after the trip that Michael was definitely the man I wanted to marry.&#160; </p>  <p>A year and half later we went out to eat at our favorite restaurant and ended the night with dessert at James at the Mill.&#160; After dessert we walked down to the fish pond and there was a bouquet of roses and an envelope with my name waiting.&#160; Michael got very lucky because I was sick that night and completely clueless to what was going on until I literally read my name on the envelope.&#160; Seriously Leslie?!&#160; The roses didn’t even tip me off.&#160; The note said to turn around and there was my Michael down on one knee.&#160; After he proposed we both couldn’t remember if I actually said yes what with all the crying, laughing and hugging.&#160; But I think he got the idea.&#160; We had a Christmas wedding 6 months later at Central United Methodist in Fayetteville.&#160; Such sweet memories and so many more sweet memories to make.&#160; All my love to you Michael John Paladino.   <br />&#160;&#160;
