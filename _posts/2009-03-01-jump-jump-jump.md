<p>Apparently Gabby had some bottled up energy this evening and it all came out in at least a 30 minute jumping session on our bed.&nbsp; She's watching herself in the mirror and yes she gets close to the edge but don't worry, she's in complete control (uh, or just lucky she didn't fall off).&nbsp; </p> <p>In the first video she is singing a song from her new video which is a live Christian children's concert.&nbsp; Thanks Aunt Patty!&nbsp; These have definitely replaced the Lady Bugs video.&nbsp; She's saying "turn around, turn around" at first and then launches into her version of "jump, jump, jump into the light, light, light, run, run, run from the dark, dark night."&nbsp; And yes, she does end with a "poopee" which is not on her video.</p> <p>In the second video she is doing a little faith healing that we've been practicing at home.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; We're not sure where she got her moves but she's definitely passionate about it.&nbsp; </p> <p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:3b889b84-b464-43ce-953c-78dcbca5bb50" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><div><embed width="448" height="361" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" src="http://i170.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid170.photobucket.com/albums/u252/mjpalad/P1030604.flv"></div></div></p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:2a6a3085-298b-4ef6-94fc-1f7e823c26e3" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><div><embed width="448" height="361" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" src="http://i170.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid170.photobucket.com/albums/u252/mjpalad/P1030605.flv"></div></div>
