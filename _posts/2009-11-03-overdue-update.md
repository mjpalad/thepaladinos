title: "Overdue Update"

<p>Sorry it’s been so long since the last update.&#160; I’m sure I’m leaving things out since it’s been so long but I’ll try to remember what all we’ve been up to.&#160; Peter Michael is about to turn 5 months old.&#160; Can you believe it?!&#160; I really really wish that I could say that he has started sleeping through the night but I can’t.&#160; I’m sure this will sound pretty strange but as parents of a newborn you’ll try just about anything so what the heck.&#160; A few weeks ago we moved Peter Michael into our closet.&#160; That’s right, he has a perfectly good room with a nice comfy bed, but he prefers to sleep in a pack n play in our closet.&#160; We originally moved him there so that we could let him cry a little at night without having him wake up Gabby.&#160; But as soon as we moved him he started sleeping until 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning.&#160; Don’t get too excited, that was just for about a week.&#160; Yesterday morning he was up at 1:30 to eat and up for good at 5:00.&#160; We had a similar morning today as well.&#160; Last Thursday we started him on rice cereal and pears.&#160; There is a video below if you would like to see how that went.&#160; He hasn’t made much progress but he doesn’t cry anymore at least.&#160; The boy has never turned down a meal as you can tell so I’m sure he’ll like it more soon.</p>  <p>As for Miss Gabby, or “Tinker Bell” as we now like to go by, she is big into princess/pretend.&#160; As you can see from the pictures below she was Sleeping Beauty for Halloween.&#160; She dressed up for a party on Wednesday, for MDO on Thursday and spent Halloween in Berryville with Mimi, Papa Mike, Arleigh and Drew.&#160; She is not ready for Halloween to be over and has decided to be Tinker Bell for Halloween next year.&#160; We might have to get a Tinker Bell outfit for Christmas or her birthday if this keeps up.&#160; She has entered into the dreaded “why?” stage.&#160; We went to Wal-Mart yesterday and I literally don’t think that she took a breath around all the questions.&#160; Everything is “why?” and a half the time I don’t think she even knows she’s saying it. </p>  <p>We’re about to enter into our crazy holiday schedule with plans just about every weekend until January.&#160; So I’m sure I’ll have more to update you on soon.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0038.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px;
