title: "First Treatment at Children's"

<p>Everything went really well at Gabby's appointment at Children's this morning.  The procedure consisted of a shot of cortisone in her lip and about 5 zaps with a laser.  The whole thing only lasted about 2-3 minutes, and she was calm and back to her normal self almost immediately after.  She's been doing well all day and it doesn't seem to be bothering her at all.  Right now, the lip is pretty swollen, but that should go away in the next couple of days and go back to the way it was before or possibly a little smaller.</p>
<p>We'll go back for another treatment in 4-6 weeks depending on how the lip responds to this one.</p>
