<p>I’m a little behind on the last couple of weeks but better late than never.&#160; I think just about everyone knows about our most recent family addition but I’ll still document it here for memories sake.&#160; <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Winking smile" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" /></p>  <p>We’ve been talking about getting another dog for a couple of years but I keep putting the brakes on it because I just wasn’t ready for that responsibility again.&#160; But I finally gave in and told a very happy family that I was ready.&#160; Around 2 years ago we saw a greyhound at a neighborhood block party and loved it.&#160; Michael started researching them and convinced me that was the dog for us.&#160; They’re beautiful, well mannered, don’t bark, are crate trained, usually house trained, not a lot of health problems and they only have energy in short spurts. Otherwise they just lay around for the most part.&#160; That’s our kind of dog!&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>We started researching where to adopt greyhounds and found a shelter in Springfield.&#160; We’ve been looking at the adoptable dogs for years but again, mommy just wasn’t ready.&#160; So when I finally gave the all clear we had to fill out an application, have a home inspection/interview process (including personal references) and FINALLY pick out our new dog.&#160; Not a quick process but our boy was so worth the wait.&#160; </p>  <p>The weekend before school started we drove to Silver Dollar City for one more hoorah and stayed over in Springfield so we could visit the dogs the next day.&#160; We were going to see 3 dogs, Judy, Petals and Cher.&#160; She also told me that she was getting another dog that week but didn’t know the details yet.&#160; We had looked at each of the dogs pictures, read their descriptions over and over as well as talked to the shelter director about them.&#160; We met Cher on Friday morning before SDC because she was staying in a different home and fell in love.&#160; She was very shy and hesitant but so sweet.&#160; She had not been a racer so she hadn’t been been given the best care.&#160; And then we saw our Stan man on Saturday and fell in love with him too.&#160; He was so beautiful and easy going and HUGE.&#160; She had 10 greyhounds there and he was the biggest one.&#160; We talked it over and decided that Stanley would just be a better fit for us and might have an easier transition than Cher.&#160; So we loaded him up in the back which was no easy feat for an 80 lb dog that doesn’t know how to ride in a car.&#160; It was very odd leaving with a dog that we didn’t know anything about when we had spent so much time dreaming about the other dogs.&#160; But it didn’t take us long to fall in love with our big boy.&#160; He spent most of the first day in his kennel, wary of us and our crazy kids.&#160; But by the second day he was comfortable in his bed sleeping most of the day.&#160; </p>  <p>He’s raced in 75 races and won 13 of those.&#160; His racing name was Country Stanley and his brother, Country Sammy is still racing.&#160; The foster home we went through, <a href="http://www.gpamo.com">www.gpamo.com</a>, also adopted out his mom a few years ago and remembered her as a sweet lovable girl.&#160; We couldn’t find pictures of his mom but he looks exactly like his maternal grandpa and great grandpa.&#160; Right down to the white patch on his chest.&#160; </p>  <p>Stanley is adjusting to being a house dog quite nicely.&#160; He gets up a little early for us and is ready to go at 6:00 every morning.&#160; And he’s definitely a morning dog.&#160; He goes outside then comes in ready to play.&#160; So far that’s included playing with my bedroom curtains, pillows off the bed and a pair of pants I left out.&#160; Not to mention his other favorite pastime of raiding the kids rooms of stuffed animals and pillows.&#160; But after he’s had his breakfast he retires to his bed for most of the day.&#160; He LOVES to eat!&#160; He has playful spurts with us outside where he can run.&#160; We still need to take him to the dog park to really let him run but it’s been a little too warm.&#160; He gets hot and gives out very easily.&#160; He loves attention and is so gentle with everyone.&#160; We took him to the square Friday night and he did so good.&#160; He never showed his stress and met lots of new people.&#160; The only problems we’re having is getting him to walk on tile/wood floors.&#160; He does NOT like those and slips and slides everywhere.&#160; And he is just about impossible to get in the car.&#160; It’s a 2 person job so no quick rides to school for this boy.&#160; And it’s been an interesting adjustment to go from a 3 lb Chihuahua to an 80 lb small horse.&#160; Everything is just so big!&#160; But that’s what we wanted and Michael is so proud to have such a manly dog after having our little girly girl Ellie.&#160; Stanley has been a gentle, sweet, loving addition to our family!&#160;
