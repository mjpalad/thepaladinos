<p>Happy birthday to the sweetest boy I know!&#160; It is a blessing to be his mommy and I am so thankful for his joyful, easy going spirit.&#160; He is one of a kind and cracks us up on a daily basis.&#160; I hope that little personality never changes!&#160; </p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_6371.jpg"><img title="DSC_6371" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="DSC_6371" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_6371_thumb.jpg" width="272" height="387" /></a>    <br />Ironically Peter is celebrating his 5th birthday with Fifth Disease hence the pink cheeks.&#160; It’s going around big time here but at least the only symptom is a rash.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_6383.jpg"><img title="DSC_6383" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="DSC_6383" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_6383_thumb.jpg" width="326" height="274" /></a><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_6390.jpg"><img title="DSC_6390" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="DSC_6390" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_6390_thumb.jpg" width="294" height="197" /></a>    <br />Peter decided he wanted to just celebrate with family this year.&#160; He got to go shopping today with his birthday money which he loved and we finished off the day with mexican food and cake.&#160; He’s also asked to go camping/fishing with Mimi and Papa Mike and make his own car at Ridemakerz in Branson which we’ll be doing over the next couple of weekends.&#160; <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/Peters-5th-birthday-interview.studio3.jpg">     <br /><img title="Peters 5th birthday interview.studio3" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Peters 5th birthday interview.studio3" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/Peters-5th-birthday-interview.studio3_thumb.jpg" width="587" height="762" /></a></p>
