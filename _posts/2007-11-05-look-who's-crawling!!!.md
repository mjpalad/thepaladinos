<div>This just happened today, 11/5/2007. Gabby has decided to start crawling! Leslie put her on the floor and she started crawling like she's always known how. She's been trying to for a couple of weeks now, but this was the first time she was able to put it all together.</div>

<div>We've been hearing how our lives are gonna change as soon as she's mobile. I guess we'll find out!</div>
