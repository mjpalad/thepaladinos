<p>Gabby literally had Super Bowl fever during the big game.  101 degrees to be exact.  She caught a little something over the weekend and wasn't feeling well.  She fell asleep on Daddy while watching the game.  Don't worry she's feeling much better today!</p>

> Hey, I just was googling random names and found you!! Oh my God! You have the sweetest little girl. My husband and I of two years now are also working on starting a family. Right now, it is two yorkie pups but hopefully babies are soon!! I hope you and Leslie and Gabby are doing great and I am so stoked I found you on here. I am a pharmacist at Sam's Club in LR now and I love it----what are you doing work wise? If you are ever in LR come by and say hello at Sams. I am living in a house in Maumelle and my mom moved back from ATL and lives like two blocks away. My dad finally sold his house with Laura and they also moved to Maumelle last year and are like 3 minutes from me....Gabby is a cutie!! I am happy for you
