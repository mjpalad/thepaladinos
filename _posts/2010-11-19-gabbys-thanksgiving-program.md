<p>Gabby was in a program today at school.&#160; They’ve been practicing for weeks and everyone did a great job.&#160; Gabby was an Indian named Morning Star.&#160; If you can’t tell which one she is at first she’s in the light colored dress with the red feather.&#160; In the turkey song you’ll notice she has a funny face because she was supposed to sing it with attitude (which she knows all about).&#160; We were so proud of our little Indian princess. </p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:ea5de95d-022b-43c1-a6e4-3c117ad54a87" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oim4oqWNmvE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
