<p>Last week gifts started appearing on our front porch.&#160; The first night there was a note with a poem about a partridge in a pear tree, a basket of pears, and a book on the 12 days of Christmas.&#160; We were gone that night so we weren’t there when the gifts were dropped off.&#160; There wasn’t a name telling us who it was from so we were a little wary to say the least.&#160; The next night we were also gone and returned to a container of Dove chocolates and chocolate Turtles (2 Turtle Doves) and another note with a cute poem.&#160; At that point we started catching on that someone was acting out the 12 Days of Christmas for us (yes, we’re a little slow).&#160; The next night we were home but by the time Michael got to the door they were already gone and had left a container of Panera chicken soup, a loaf of French bread (3 French Hens) and another poem.&#160; The fourth night we were totally ready.&#160; We had our small group over for our Christmas party and had updated them on what was going on so they knew what to expect when Michael sprinted to the door.&#160; He was there seconds after they rang the bell but he still couldn’t catch them.&#160; This time we had 4 Angry Bird magnets (4 calling birds).&#160; The next night we were gone again and came home to 5 Krispy Kreme donuts (5 golden rings).&#160; Tonight I was in the office and heard them walking up the sidewalk and was on my way to the peep hole when they knocked and still couldn’t catch even a glimpse of someone.&#160; We can’t figure out how they’re moving so fast but it’s impressive!&#160; They left a candy jar with red, green, white and gold candy or our “eggs” from the 6 geese a laying.&#160; It’s been a lot of fun and is now something that we look forward to every night.&#160; I hope we’ll get to meet our mystery friends by the 12th day.&#160; If you’re reading this mystery friend, Thank you!&#160; A lot of time and effort has gone into this.&#160; And as a side note…you should totally be a spy or professional criminal or something with get away moves like those.&#160;
