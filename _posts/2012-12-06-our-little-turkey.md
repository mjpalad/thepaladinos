<blockquote></blockquote>  <p>Peter had his first program last month at his preschool.&#160; He’s never been up on the big stage before so it was pretty exciting to see him in the spotlight…until we actually saw him in the spotlight.&#160; He was cute because he’s always cute but I think he was also a little lost.&#160; He sang the first song and got into the motions a little.&#160; But by the second song he pretty much just stood there with his little mouth open looking around.&#160; Every once in awhile he would yawn or rub his eyes.&#160; But that was about it.&#160; Poor little guy.&#160; He didn’t sleep well the night before and woke up early so I think he was just tired.&#160; Or he might not be the natural performer that his big sister is which is okay with me.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3590.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_3590" border="0" alt="DSC_3590" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3590_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a>    <br />Waving as they walk in.&#160; He’s such a good little waver. :)    <br />    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3597.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_3597" border="0" alt="DSC_3597" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3597_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a>    <br />Getting into it with the first song.&#160; <br />    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3593.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_3593" border="0" alt="DSC_3593" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3593_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a>    <br />And this is pretty much him through the rest of the program.&#160; <br />    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3599.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_3599" border="0" alt="DSC_3599" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3599_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a>    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3605.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_3605" border="0" alt="DSC_3605" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3605_thumb.jpg" width="270" height="404" /></a><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3608.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_3608" border="0" alt="DSC_3608" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_3608_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a></p>
