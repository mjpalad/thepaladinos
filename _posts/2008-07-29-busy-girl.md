<p>Gabby has been a very busy girl lately.  The week before last she was in Mother's Day out two days instead of one and Wednesday she and Mommy drove to Northwest Arkansas to visit friends.  Apparently we're going to have to keep the girl on the move because she was in the best mood all week long and didn't want to stop going.  As you can see from some of the below pictures, she went swimming with her friend Hudson, then visited her friend Noah and then went swimming again with her friends Logan and Grayson all in the same day.  Wow!  She'll have a lot of boyfriends to pick from when we allow her to date at age 35.  This last Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Gramma and Grampa came down to stay with her while Mommy and Daddy got away for a few days to Tulsa.  It was a very needed break from reality and we enjoyed stuffing ourselves silly, shopping and going to movies.  Gabby had such a good time with her grandparents and I think got a little spoiled with ice cream and not hearing the word no.  But that's what grandparents are for.  This week the days we have spent at home have been very boring for Gabby so I guess we'll have to get creative this summer while it's too hot to go outside and find her other activities.  </p>
<p>Her new favorite game is playing in our shower (while it's off of course) and she begs to go to the garage to play with her stroller and "drive" the car.  No new words yet but she's been getting really good at saying please or "plah".  She's been having fun on her tummy and started laying down in the bath a couple of days ago.  She just lays down on her tummy and kicks in the water.  It's pretty cute.  Today we went to story time at the library.  She was more in to pushing her stroller than listening but we'll keep trying it.  She did enjoy the snack time and playing in the kids section after story time.</p>
<p>We got a new "professional" camera so some of the shots below are just trying that out.  I'm sure we'll have people begging us to take their picture in no time.  :)</p>

> I've been waiting for this!!  I knew things were happenin' and am glad for the update as to what!  Social butterflies - how nice to have a network and dating society already in place!  She will be such good friends with these young males that she won't want to date any of them!!!  (If you are lucky.)  It will be interesting to see who she does select!  Luv and thanks for the pictures.
