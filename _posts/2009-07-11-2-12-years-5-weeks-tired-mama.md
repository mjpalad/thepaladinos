<p>Well, we made it past the first month with two kids.&#160; But just barely.&#160; :)&#160; Both kids are doing well.&#160; Peter Michael seems to be growing extremely fast.&#160; As you can see from the pictures he is very healthy and loves to eat.&#160; We're still trying to figure out who he looks like.&#160; I think he really looked a lot like his Uncle Rob at first but he's changed now and I'm not sure anymore.&#160; Sometimes he really looks like Gabby as a baby and a lot of people say he looks like Michael.&#160; You be the judge.&#160; He's sleeping about the same at night which could be worse but the fact that I haven't had more than 2 hours of straight sleep in over a month is starting to take it's toll on my sanity.&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby is still doing well as a big sister.&#160; For the most part she ignores him or helps take care of him.&#160; She takes her roll as Keeper of the Pacifier very seriously.&#160; He was crying on the bed the other day while I was in the bathroom.&#160; I walked back in and she had stopped playing to climb up on the bed and put his paci in his mouth.&#160; She always says &quot;Bubba crying, needs paci.&quot;&#160; </p>  <p>I tried to venture out with both kids to Wal-mart this week and that will definitely be the last time I try that.&#160; I'll leave off all the details but we'll just say it was pretty traumatic.&#160; Monday Gabby camped with Papa Mike and Mimi at Roaring River.&#160; She did very well from what they say and we visited them again today at the camp and had a lot of fun.&#160; This next week we'll probably stick pretty close to home.</p>  <p><em>Baby picture comparisons.&#160; Here it looks like he might be a nice combo of Mommy and Daddy.&#160; He definitely has Michael's face shape and nose (and hairline).&#160;&#160;
