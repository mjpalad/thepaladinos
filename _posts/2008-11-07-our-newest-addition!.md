I think just about everyone knows by now but just in case not, we'll be adding a new member to our family next year.  I will be 11 weeks pregnant on Monday and our due date is June 1st.  So far I definitely feel and look pregnant.  I've been nauseous off and on and feel pretty tired and hungry most of the time.  But hopefully that will pass soon.  Gabby looks pretty confused when we try to tell her there's a baby in mommy's tummy so I guess we'll have to keep working on that.

We had our first doctor's appointment and ultrasound last week.  The baby has a good heartbeat and was sleeping soundly (maybe this will be a relaxed baby).  The ultrasound photo is below.  The baby's head is on the right and you can kind of make out little arms and legs on the left.  We're very excited and can't wait to find out what we're having and to meet our little baby.
