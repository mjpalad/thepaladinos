<p>Just in case you haven&#8217;t heard the latest I wanted to give you an update on Peter Michael.&#160; I have been having some irregular contractions since last Thursday and was very hopeful that I would go into labor over the weekend.&#160; However, I had another checkup yesterday and am still only at a 1 and haven&#8217;t changed a bit.&#160; I guess PM is very comfortable which we&#8217;re hoping means that he will be the laid back baby that we&#8217;ve dreamed of.&#160; His sister of course punched her way out a week early and hasn&#8217;t stopped going since.&#160; It&#8217;s been very strange how different my two pregnancies have been and will be interesting to see how different the labor is.&#160; Hopefully we&#8217;ll end up with a safe delivery and healthy baby as before.&#160; </p>  <p>Since I am now officially over my due date we have decided to go ahead and induce.&#160; I go into the hospital tomorrow at 4:00 pm and they will start me on a slow acting medicine to help me dilate.&#160; Early the next morning they will break my water and possibly give me another drug, pitocin, to really get things going.&#160; If all goes as planned Peter Michael Paladino should be here by noonish.&#160;&#160;&#160; We are very excited and anxious to meet this little boy.&#160; It&#8217;s crazy to think that we will have a son in a couple of days.&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby has been warming to the idea of a baby brother.&#160; She still isn&#8217;t sure about sharing mommy and daddy or her bathroom though.&#160; She is such a funny girl.&#160; You never know what will come out of her mouth or what she will do.&#160; It&#8217;s amazing how much she has changed and really turned into a big girl.&#160; She will be such a little helper with her baby &#8220;bubba.&#8221;&#160; </p>  <p>Finally we&#8217;re also getting some pictures of the house out before it&#8217;s covered with baby swings, chairs, etc.&#160; I guess the next post you see will be with a picture of our Peter Michael.&#160; Yea!!</p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2009-06-02-DSC_0102_1.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="DSC_0102" style="border-top-width: 0px;
