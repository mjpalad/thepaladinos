title: "1st Day of Kindergarten!"

<p>Today our Gabby girl started her first day of kindergarten.&#160; Wasn’t it just yesterday that I shakingly told Michael “ummm, I think my water just broke.”&#160; I have no doubt that those parents who say it will fly by and she will be graduating from high school before you know it are right.&#160; What a treasure our first 5 years with this little princess, rockstar, diva have been.&#160; I cry over what I’m loosing but am so excited for what’s ahead.</p>  <p>We have been in a whirlwind of “doing” before she starts school for the past two weeks.&#160; School supplies, school clothes, going to jump zone, the pool, Chuck E Cheese, play dates, etc. because we have to fit it all in before we’re locked down by a school schedule.&#160; But we have been blessed to be in a year round school with lots of breaks throughout the year which makes this obsessive mama feel much better.&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby said she wanted to have a party before starting school so we had some friends meet us at chick-fil-a to play and have cupcakes yesterday.&#160; With 5 girls and poor Peter there was of course a little drama and a whole lot of giggles.&#160; What sweet friends we have.</p>  <p>At 7:20 this morning we arrived at school and walked our little big girl in and said goodbye.&#160; She was nervous with the crazy noise and people everywhere but once she got into her class she put on a smile and started coloring.&#160; At registration earlier this year she saw a really cute classroom that she wanted to be in and that happens to be the one we got!&#160; She also has a friend in her class from her preschool which is a big help.&#160; Her mom and I will be the classroom moms which I’m really looking forward to (I might have a problem with control). :) </p>  <p>After I sat in the car line (for 40 minutes!!!) to pick her up she bounced to the car with her teacher and said that it “was awesome.”&#160; Now of course she says she was bored but she’s just trying to play it cool.&#160; Her favorite part was lunch because she could have some private time which I think translates to she didn’t have anyone telling her what to do.&#160; :(&#160; It makes me sad that she needed that break but it’s also good for her to have structure.&#160; So I guess this begins our days of getting up early, getting to bed early too and life revolving around school (or so it feels).&#160;
