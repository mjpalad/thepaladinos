title: "Gabby's Strawberry Birthmark"
date: 2007-04-24

<p>At about 3 weeks old, Gabby had a red mark show up on her lip that looked like a scratch.  After a couple of weeks of not going away, we took her to the pediatrician's office and found out it is the beginnings of a strawberry birthmark.  The official name is "Infantile Hemangioma" and from what we read, they grow for the first year or so of a child's life, then begin to recede at some point after that.  They eventually go away leaving anything from no marks at all to significant scarring.</p>
<p>Obviously, we don't want Gabby to have to deal with the social issues of having a growth on her lip, but more importantly it could get bigger which could effect her eating.  So, thanks to much prayer and the persistence of our pediatrician's office, we got an appointment at the <a href="http://www.birthmarks.org/index.asp" target="_blank">Vascular Anomalies Center</a> at <a href="http://www.archildrens.org/" target="_blank">Arkansas Children's Hospital</a> in Little Rock for May 21.  At first, they offered us an appointment next February, but eventually ended up moving us to the May appointment for which we are extremely grateful.  From what we understand, they sometimes let the strawberry run its course and other times they decide to treat it.  Treatments typically involve a series of steroid injections and laser treatment, but we'll have to wait and find out what the doctor tells us in May.</p>
<p>If you would like to get more information, see the <a href="http://www.birthmarks.org/info.asp#hemangiomas" target="_blank">infantile hemangioma section of the website for the Vascular Anomalies Center at Children's</a>.  However, I warn you there are some pretty extreme images on their site.  We're hoping Gabby will never get to anything close to that since we've caught it early and are hopefully getting treatment.</p>

> Hi! I found your blog by googling "strawberry birthmarks". My 3 month old daughter has a hemangioma on her right lower eye lid. They are going to laser it off in a few weeks. I was wondering if I could e-mail you some questions I have about the process. Thank you so much!! <br>sheenacosby@yahoo.com

> How ironic! I have a daughter named Gabby and she also has a hemangioma! It is located on her lower left lip area. We started her on steroids when she was two months and are slowly weaning her off. It has started to involute but will probably need some corrective surgery or laser. She is 11 months and such a sweet baby. I wish you all the best!

> Hi, my son is son to be 4 months old, and he also had developed a hemangioma between his eyes, (closer to his right eye), doctors are worried that it could effect his vision and airway. Doctors are going to start steroid treatment next week, but i'm defitnetly worried about the affect that it may have on that specific location of the lesion..It's always good to find new information and to know others that are going thru the same situation...God Bless to all, and I hope that all works out well for each and everyone of you...:)

> Hi
> I too googled ‘strawberry birthmark’ and came across your story! Gabby is gorgeous btw – and to me….you would hardly notice her lip only that it was highlighted on the thread!
> My one year old daughter also has a SB BM on her upper lip – probably now about the size of half my small fingernail. We did have her with specialist dermatologists in the past year – but they are very happy with her progress (and the BM progress), and are confident it should disappear by the time she is 3-4…..maybe it’s a European thing, but they don’t want to do any laser / steroid treatment until she reaches 4-5 if the BM is still there. I do worry that it will leave a mark, wont disappear,and am concerned about the LT impact this will have on her (if any I know!) – so I would be really interested to hear from anyone out there who had no option but to wait before treatment – was laser / steroid treatment required? Did the BM fade of its own accord?
> Many thanks all – in a lot of ways, I know this is a ‘minor’ issue in the grand scheme of things – but its all still a concern!

> Hi!  I was looking up birthmarks as my 1 month old has a angel kiss on her eyelid.  It looked different that the strawberry birthmark I had as a baby, so wanted to see what it was.  I had a SB right in the middle of my chin.  It never got really big, and it faded before I was old enough to care about it - about 7 years old.  I don't think my parents ever considered treating it, but it didn't interfere with my vision or anything.  Just wanted to say that they usually do go away and not too worry too much about kids being teased until the get to school age.  People would ask me about mine, but it never bothered me at that age.  I guess my parents never made me feel like there was anything wrong with me, so I didn't think there was.  :)  Good luck to you all!

> Hi!
> My one month old daughter has a strawberry on the side of her face.  She is so cute, but this birthmark is so big and ugly.  Doctors say it will probally fade by age 7 and not to do anything about it.  I really want it lasered off, but I heard that  doing that might leave more damage.  I don't know what to do.  Kids can be cruel and I don't want her to get teased.

>                  Thank you for your advice with my daughter.   The birthmark on her lip is getting bigger and it is under her left nostril.   I took her to the pediatrician and they agreed with me to get an appointment with Chop, so they should be calling me back.    It is getting redder and also bigger,  and it is bothering her breathing through her nose.

I hope we are doing the right thing with our daughter because it gets bigger and bigger every day.

> We took my daughter to Chop and the dermatologist put her on the medication of propranolol and they had to monitor her in the hospital for a week.   She did really good, and they also put her on the steroids.   It dramatically changed.   It got smaller and softer too.    We took her off the steroids for the two months because I did not want her on them too long.    She is still taking the propranolol three times a day, she is taking 1.6 ml.    She is having trouble sleeping, and I do not know because this might be on the medication because she is not sleeping through the night and she is now 7 months old.    I am pleased with her progress , and the medication seems like it is working.  I just hope she does not have side effects in the future.

> My daughter, Emily is now one years old and she is still on the propranapol.   It has made a difference with her lip because it is fading away.   They have to keep her on it for three more months and then they will wean her off of it.   This medication made a difference with my daughter.
