<p>I’m finally getting around to posting pictures from Easter weekend.&#160; </p>  <p>Over the last couple of months I’ve been in a Bible study at church on the Gospels.&#160; Really digging in and studying Jesus life and death has been so good and really made this Easter special.&#160; I simply can’t comprehend the love that He has for us and the sacrifice that He made for us.&#160; But I’m so thankful that I don’t have to comprehend it to receive it.&#160; He loves crazy, neurotic, sin filled me even though I could never come close to deserving it.&#160; </p>  <p align="left">John 15:9 says “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.” and John17:23 says “I in them and you in me-so that they may be brought to complete unity.&#160; Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.”&#160; That’s how much we are loved!&#160; With the same love that God and Jesus have for each other.&#160; Wow!   <br /><em><font size="2"><sup>         <br />20 </sup>“My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, <sup>21 </sup>that all of them may be one,<sup></sup> Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.<sup></sup> May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.<sup></sup> <sup>22 </sup>I have given them the glory that you gave me,<sup></sup> that they may be one as we are one<sup></sup>— <sup>23 </sup>I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me<sup></sup> and have loved them<sup></sup> even as you have loved me.&#160; </font></em><em><font size="2"><sup>24 </sup>“Father, I want those you have given me<sup></sup> to be with me where I am,<sup></sup> and to see my glory,<sup></sup> the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.&#160; </font></em><em><font size="2"><sup>25 </sup>“Righteous Father, though the world does not know you,<sup></sup> I know you, and they know that you have sent me.<sup></sup> <sup>26 </sup>I have made you<sup>[<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-26786e">e</a>]</sup> known to them,<sup></sup> and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them<sup></sup> and that I myself may be in them.” -- <em><font size="2">John 17:20-26</font></em></font></em></p>  <p align="left">   <br />Gabby had an Easter egg hunt at school.    <br /><a href="/assets/images/DSC_4401.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4401" border="0" alt="DSC_4401" src="/assets/images/DSC_4401_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a><a href="/assets/images/DSC_4405.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4405" border="0" alt="DSC_4405" src="/assets/images/DSC_4405_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a><a href="/assets/images/DSC_4409.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4409" border="0" alt="DSC_4409" src="/assets/images/DSC_4409_thumb.jpg" width="270" height="404" /></a><a href="/assets/images/DSC_4413.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4413" border="0" alt="DSC_4413" src="/assets/images/DSC_4413_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a>    <br />Loved seeing these two play together.&#160; A rare sweet moment between siblings.&#160; <br />    <br /><a href="/assets/images/DSC_4418.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4418" border="0" alt="DSC_4418" src="/assets/images/DSC_4418_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a>    <br />Miss Sassy pants just had to strike a pose with our dyed eggs (and yes of course that’s a swimsuit and ballet skirt she’s wearing).</p>  <p align="left"><a href="/assets/images/DSC_4424.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4424" border="0" alt="DSC_4424" src="/assets/images/DSC_4424_thumb.jpg" width="270" height="404" /></a><a href="/assets/images/DSC_4425.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4425" border="0" alt="DSC_4425" src="/assets/images/DSC_4425_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a>    <br />Easter baskets.&#160; Can you tell which one of the kids doesn’t like to have their picture taken right now?
