<p>Michael and I vaguely remember when we used to go out for our entertainment.&#160; A movie, club or just hanging out with kids.&#160; This week Gabby has provided a totally different kind of show for us.&#160; In the video below she created her own drum station complete with stool all by herself.&#160; The drum solo video is thanks to her Uncle John and Uncle David who thought it would be funny to get drum sticks for her for Christmas.&#160; Yes they’re loud but they did turn out to be pretty funny this night.&#160; We don’t have a video of it but tonight she serenaded us for about an hour with her own Christmas mix of Rocking Around the Christmas Tree and Deck the Halls.&#160; </p>
<p>We keep wondering what our kids will do when they get older.&#160; We’re pretty sure that Peter Michael will be an NFL star someday with legs like those.&#160; But Gabby has us totally stumped.&#160; She likes art and music obviously but is also very structured for an artist.&#160; She loves to line things up and put things in order.&#160; It will definitely be interesting to see what she does.&#160; </p>

<em>With that hair and drum performance don’t you think she’s perfect for an 80’s hair band?</em>
