<p>We took a little trip to Big Cedar as our quick trip summer vacation.&#160; We loved it!&#160; Lazy river, swimming pools, mini golf, beach with paddle boats, canoes and kayaks.&#160; It was seriously perfect.&#160; So glad we have access to so many amazing places close to home.&#160; I didn’t get many pictures because we were in the water so much.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_4938.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4938" border="0" alt="DSC_4938" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_4938_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a>     <br />Gramma &amp; Gabby in the paddle boat and Daddy &amp; Peter in the canoe.     <br />    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_4940.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4940" border="0" alt="DSC_4940" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_4940_thumb.jpg" width="270" height="404" /></a>     <br />Don’t they look excited to have their picture taken!     <br />    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_4948.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_4948" border="0" alt="DSC_4948" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_4948_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a></p>
