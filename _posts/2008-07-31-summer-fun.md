<p>Look at this, two blog entries in one week!  GranDeb will be so excited.  We just wanted to share the fun summer day that Gabby had today.  It rained for a few minutes so she played outside in the rain (which we don't have a picture of, but you do get to see the curls that showed up even more after the rain).  We ran back and forth on the sidewalk and she loved just standing there getting wet.  She had watermelon for dinner which you can see she also loved.    <br/>
