<p>The weekend before last we went to the square to look at lights.&#160; They had the cutest little carriage ride for the kids with a little pony.&#160; Gabby loved it!&#160; Peter didn’t want to have anything to do with it.&#160; </p>  

<p>Gabby also lost another tooth last Sunday (top tooth)!&#160; This is her 3rd tooth and she lost this one at church.&#160; It was sooo loose for days but she really didn’t want us to pull it (and by us I mean Michael because I still can’t do it).&#160; So she wiggled it and wiggled it until it finally just fell right out.&#160; She was so excited and looks so cute with that big hole in her smile.&#160; </p>  

<p>In fact Gabby was so excited that she had a little trouble sleeping that night.&#160; The Tooth Fairy tried visiting her twice before bed and Gabby woke up both times.&#160; But luckily the Tooth Fairy has trouble sleeping and visited at 3:00 am.&#160; But unluckily for the Tooth Fairy Gabby was still having trouble sleeping and started rolling around during the visit.&#160; So the Tooth Fairy had to hit the floor and belly crawl up to her pillow.&#160; Let’s just say, the Tooth Fairy had a really hard time going back to sleep after that.&#160; <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/wlEmoticon-smile.png" />&#160;</p>
