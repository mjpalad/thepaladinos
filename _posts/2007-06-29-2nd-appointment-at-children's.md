title: "2nd Appointment at Children's"

<p>Yesterday was Gabby's second appointment for her lip at Children's.  The doctor was excited about how much it had gone down and actually opted not to do the shot of cortisone this time because of how good it looked.  He went ahead and did the laser treatment to help with the redness and setup another appointment for July 26 to go back and actually get the shot of cortisone.</p>
<p>We are extremely thankful that Gabby has been so great during and after the appointments so far.  She cried while getting the laser treatment but quit crying and was back to her normal self immediately after.  This whole process, including seeing all the other children with problems, has made us extremely grateful to have a healthy baby.  A little strawberry is so minor compared to what some others have to deal with.  However, we do still appreciate everyone who is praying for us as we will be continuing to get treatments in the next few months.</p>
