<p>We had newborn pictures done with <a href="http://www.photographywithpassion.com" target="_blank">Bob Dyer</a> last Saturday and have added a few of those pictures here.  Bob is the same photographer that did Leslie's maternity pictures.  We've really enjoyed working with him and have been extremely pleased with his work.</p>
