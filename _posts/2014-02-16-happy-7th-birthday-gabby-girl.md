<p>Tomorrow my baby girl turns 7!&#160; At other birthdays it has seemed bitter sweet.&#160; I wanted to hold her back and keep her from growing up too fast.&#160; But this year I see the little lady that she’s turning into and I’m excited to watch it happen.&#160; She is so full of life and energy and passion.&#160; Now let’s be honest, sometimes that passion pushes my buttons like nothing else on this earth but at the same time I know that is part of what makes her special.&#160; She’s going to be a button pusher and a game changer for the world.&#160; She feels what she feels and NO ONE can change that.&#160; She’s not afraid to be different.&#160; She’s sensitive, creative and smart.&#160; I can’t imagine what God has in store for her future and what she will become.&#160; She already feels that God has called her to be a leader.&#160; But what will that look like?&#160; A leader in the church, in business, in entertainment.&#160; Or maybe just a mommy who leads her children to Christ.&#160; Whatever it is, I know that she will do it all the way and with flair.&#160;&#160; To say I love this little girl is an understatement.&#160; Happy Birthday sweet Gabby with many more to follow.</p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_6093.jpg"><img title="DSC_6093" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="DSC_6093" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_6093_thumb.jpg" width="251" height="375" /></a></p>
