<p>This year Santa’s little helper has an attitude. <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=Windows-Live-Writer/Dancing-Elf/2C526970/wlEmoticon-smile.png" />&#160; Peter’s not a big fan of these pj’s but I talked him into them last night.&#160; I guess we’ve made fun of him a little too much (lovingly of course) when he wears these.&#160; Just can’t resist though.&#160; Cutest darn elf ever!&#160; And when you add dancing to it you just can’t get better entertainment.&#160; Love my funny little man.</p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:dc009dd1-a36b-49fe-b844-bac7037e19e5" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div><object width="448" height="252"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q26KLVDEqA4?hl=en&amp;hd=1"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q26KLVDEqA4?hl=en&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="448" height="252"></embed></object></div></div>

> Dear Future Peter,

I'm really sorry that your mom and I put you through this and publicly posted it online. I'm sure you're now a professional and trying to portray a certain image, and videos of you dancing to &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; in elf pajamas probably isn't helping. However, you've got to understand that we really didn't have a choice. When your 3-year-old self did things like this, it was our duty to share and bring a little light into this world. :)

Love you, big guy.

Dad

> Peter, keep on dancing for the rest of your life. And the best part is that &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; is your dad's ring tone on my phone. Someday I'll have to show you Chris and your dad's dinosaur movie.
