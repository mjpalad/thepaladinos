<p>
Last weekend we celebrated Gabby&#39;s 2nd birthday.&nbsp; Can you believe our baby is 2!&nbsp; She might have been a little overwhelmed with everything but had a good time.&nbsp; The theme was cupcakes this year and she got to pick out her chocolate one with blue icing.&nbsp; She was much less hesitant about eating it this year instead of just picking at it like last year.&nbsp; Thank you to everyone for all of her wonderful presents.&nbsp; They are still keeping her very entertained.
