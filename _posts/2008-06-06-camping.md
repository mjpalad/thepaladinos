<p>Sorry, we've gotten a little behind with our blogging.  A couple of weekends ago we went camping with Papa Mike, Mimi and Arleigh.  We all had a great time and Gabby loved being outdoors.  She got to see trout at a hatchery, play on a jungle gym, swing with cousin Arleigh, etc.  We won't talk about the sleeping situation or lack there of but other than that we had a really good time. </p>
