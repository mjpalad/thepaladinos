<p>Whoops!&#160; I kind of missed a whole Summer of blogging there.&#160; But that’s kind of been my pattern over the last few months.&#160; We had a great Summer but it definitely seemed too short.&#160; We started back to school last Friday with one big change this year.&#160; My baby is in Kindergarten!&#160; I have been dreading this for the past year and have done a lot of worrying over whether or not he’s ready and what my life as a mommy with 2 kids in school is going to look like.&#160; My anxiety definitely kicked it up a notch last week with the day finally approaching but with sweet prayers from friends and some quiet time myself God gave me a peace and assurance that he is holding my little ones.&#160; So we all made it through the first day without any tears and everyone came home with big smiles at the end of the day,</p>  <p>We’re one week in at this point and everyone is still all smiles.&#160; Peter has surprised me with how well he’s doing.&#160; If I remember correctly after Gabby’s first week of Kindergarten she was exhausted and an emotional mess.&#160; But Peter hasn’t even fallen asleep on the couch once which is kind of his thing.&#160; He can fall asleep anywhere in any position.&#160; I mean seriously…he has a gift!&#160; These are pictures from just one week of Peter’s summer.&#160; <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none;

</p>  <p>He loves recess of course and playing with toys when they first get into the classroom.&#160; I have to do a lot of digging to get much more information out of him in typical boy fashion.&#160; His teacher is Dr. Ross and we think she will be the perfect teacher for Peter because she is very structured.&#160; He hasn’t made any friends yet but I’m guessing he plays with people more than he’s saying.&#160; I get a lot of “it’s hard to remember” when I ask questions.&#160; I’ve been walking him in until this morning and a few days ago I asked him if he was ready to walk in by himself yet or if he was still nervous.&#160; He said “Mom, I’m not scared!&#160; I just want to spend a little more time with you.”&#160; <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=Windows-Live-Writer/1st-Day-of-School/0ECBFAF8/wlEmoticon-smile.png" /> Melt my heart!&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby is loving 2nd grade so far.&#160; She has Mrs. Bever who seems very sweet and Gabby loves her.&#160; She has a lot of friends in her class this year and has already made a new friend.&#160; Last year she was a little iffy on reading but she said it’s her favorite thing so far this year.&#160; I think she will have a little more independence this year which she will love.&#160; She even has text books this year.&#160; Yikes!&#160; Science and Social Studies.&#160; I wasn’t ready to see those in her little cubby but I guess that has to start at some point.&#160; She’s such a smarty pants like her daddy though thank goodness so she’ll do fine.&#160; And she loves that her little brother is at school with her.&#160; She proudly walked him to class this morning and they say they’re so excited to see each other at the end of the day waiting for pick up.&#160; When I pulled up today I caught her giving him a kiss on the head.&#160; Love seeing how close they’ve gotten lately!&#160; </p>  <p>And I have been enjoying the last week.&#160; With the kids gone I finally have time to do my nails every day, lounge in bubble baths, and spend most of the afternoon watching my stories.&#160; Ha!&#160; Right!&#160; But I have to admit that I’ve struggled with the perception people will have of me still staying at home even though the kids are in school.&#160; I assume that’s what people are going to think I spend my day doing.&#160; But God is working on me about that too and I’m trying to appreciate the fact that I have been given the gift of being ABLE to stay at home.&#160; I’ve spent a couple of days at school doing Tuesday folders and helping in the office which I think I will love.&#160; This is the first year that I won’t be home room mom which is kind of a relief.&#160; But I can definitely find ways to keep myself busy at school or at home so don’t judge me people!&#160; Oops sorry.&#160;

I’m still working on that.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=Windows-Live-Writer/1st-Day-of-School/3F22F57B/DSC_6397.jpg"><img title="DSC_6397" style="border-top: 0px;

I think this has been one of the hardest things for me to get used to.&#160; Having him get out of the car with his sister this morning.&#160; And sitting in car line without him, then seeing him run to the car and get in all by himself.&#160;
