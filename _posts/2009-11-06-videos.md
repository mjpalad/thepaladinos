<p>Just wanted to add a note about the videos.&nbsp; The site that we upload too has changed some of their settings which is making the videos not work as well.&nbsp; The play button that is on the actual video picture does not work.&nbsp; To get them to play you will have to use the play button on the menu bar under each video.&nbsp; You might also have trouble with sound on the video.&nbsp; If so there is a volume control on the same menu bar under each video.&nbsp; If you are still having problems just email me and we'll see what we can do.&nbsp; </p>
