<p>Gabby has been a lot of fun the past few weeks.&#160; She's saying more and more words and is really starting to try to copy things that we say or do.&#160; I'm not going to include a list of her new words because there are just too many.&#160; She can pretty much say anything that we can (even though you might not be able to understand it).&#160; She has been such a good girl lately and really seems to be getting happier now that she can do more things and communicate better.&#160; Not that she hasn't always been a happy girl, but she's definitely been a little more on the negative side in the past.&#160; She's very cuddly and loves to give hugs and kisses.&#160; She loves to investigate things and hears a lot of &quot;no no Gabby.&quot;&#160; But we have found that time outs in the crib are pretty effective if we really need to get a point across.&#160; She still loves to get up in her crib and play by herself.&#160; She can go for 15-30 minutes of just playing with her stuffed pony (thank you Aunt Patty) in her crib by herself.&#160; She likes to cover her stuffed animals up and give them bottles, etc.&#160; She also lays down with them and pats them like she's a little mommy.&#160; She loves to be tickled under the chin and arms and on her sides.&#160; At the moment she loves to eat turkey hot dogs and any kind of fruit.&#160; She's down to one nap a day which usually goes for about 2 hours.&#160; She's still going to Mother's Day Out 2 days a week and loves it.&#160; I don't even get a bye when I drop her off.&#160; She just goes right in.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>We've included a few pictures from a &quot;Touch-A-Truck&quot; event at Chick-Fil-A a couple of weeks ago where they had different trucks that kids could see and ride on/in.&#160; Also a few more cute pics and a funny video in the bath.&#160; I know we probably shouldn't do nudey shots in the bath anymore but this was just too cute.&#160; Be sure to turn up your sound and listen to the words.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>   <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:ec5b6929-6974-42e7-af36-7dd7f0278993" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><div><embed width="448" height="361" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" src="http://i170.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid170.photobucket.com/albums/u252/mjpalad/P1030352.flv"></div></div> </p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/img005_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="266" alt="Touch-A-Truck at Chick-Fil-A" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/img005_thumb.jpg" width="354" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/img006_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="266" alt="Touch-A-Truck at Chick-Fil-A" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/img006_thumb.jpg" width="353" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0001-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="237" alt="Gabby in her Fire Chief hat from Touch-A-Truck" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0001-1_thumb.jpg" width="354" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0030.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="354" alt="Upset Gabby" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0030_thumb.jpg" width="237" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0052.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="354" alt="At the nature center" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0052_thumb.jpg" width="237" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0099_041.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="354" alt="At the nature center" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/DSC_0099_041_thumb.jpg" width="237" border="0" /></a></p>
