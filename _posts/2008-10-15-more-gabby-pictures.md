<p>Gabby has been a lot of fun the past few weeks.  She's saying more and more words and is really starting to try to copy things that we say or do.  I'm not going to include a list of her new words because there are just too many.  She can pretty much say anything that we can (even though you might not be able to understand it).  She has been such a good girl lately and really seems to be getting happier now that she can do more things and communicate better.  Not that she hasn't always been a happy girl, but she's definitely been a little more on the negative side in the past.  She's very cuddly and loves to give hugs and kisses.  She loves to investigate things and hears a lot of "no no Gabby."  But we have found that time outs in the crib are pretty effective if we really need to get a point across.  She still loves to get up in her crib and play by herself.  She can go for 15-30 minutes of just playing with her stuffed pony (thank you Aunt Patty) in her crib by herself.  She likes to cover her stuffed animals up and give them bottles, etc.  She also lays down with them and pats them like she's a little mommy.  She loves to be tickled under the chin and arms and on her sides.  At the moment she loves to eat turkey hot dogs and any kind of fruit.  She's down to one nap a day which usually goes for about 2 hours.  She's still going to Mother's Day Out 2 days a week and loves it.  I don't even get a bye when I drop her off.  She just goes right in.    </p> <p>We've included a few pictures from a "Touch-A-Truck" event at Chick-Fil-A a couple of weeks ago where they had different trucks that kids could see and ride on/in.  Also a few more cute pics and a funny video in the bath.  I know we probably shouldn't do nudey shots in the bath anymore but this was just too cute.  Be sure to turn up your sound and listen to the words.   </p> <p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:ec5b6929-6974-42e7-af36-7dd7f0278993" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><div><embed height="361" src="http://i170.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid170.photobucket.com/albums/u252/mjpalad/P1030352.flv" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="448" wmode="transparent"/></div></div> </p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-10-15-img005_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Touch-A-Truck at Chick-Fil-A" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/images/2008-10-15-img005_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="354"/></a></p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-10-15-img006_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Touch-A-Truck at Chick-Fil-A" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/images/2008-10-15-img006_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="353"/></a></p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-10-15-DSC_0001-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Gabby in her Fire Chief hat from Touch-A-Truck" border="0" height="237" src="/assets/images/2008-10-15-DSC_0001-1_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="354"/></a></p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-10-15-DSC_0030.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Upset Gabby" border="0" height="354" src="/assets/images/2008-10-15-DSC_0030_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="237"/></a></p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-10-15-DSC_0052.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="At the nature center" border="0" height="354" src="/assets/images/2008-10-15-DSC_0052_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="237"/></a></p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-10-15-DSC_0099_041.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="At the nature center" border="0" height="354" src="/assets/images/2008-10-15-DSC_0099_041_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" width="237"/></a></p>
