<p>We’ve been waiting for months for Peter Michael to crawl and today he FINALLY started his broke leg crawl.&#160; It’s the funniest crawl I’ve ever seen.&#160; It looks like someone broke both of his legs and he just has to pull himself along.&#160; He can get up in position with his legs in the “normal” crawl position with no problem but for some reason he prefers this.&#160; I know he’s going to be into everything but I really am ready for him to crawl so that he isn’t so frustrated.&#160; We’ll see what I’m saying in a few days.&#160; </p>  <p>For an update on Hoppy, Gabby has been doing good with it.&#160; She slept fine last night and hasn’t asked for him too much today.&#160; It’s just when she’s feeling whiny that she wants him but she hasn’t actually gotten upset over him.&#160; She did not want to take a nap today but I don’t think that has anything to do with Hoppy.&#160; She just wasn’t tired.&#160; Tonight she went to bed with no problems.&#160; I know it probably sounds cruel to take away her lovey but we just felt like it was holding her back a little and we wanted to see how she did without him.&#160; We would bring him back if she really got upset over it but so far so good.&#160; </p>  <p><em>This was his second crawl a few seconds after he did it for the first time.&#160; Luckily Michael was home for lunch and got to witness the miracle.</em>     <br /></p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:9527eea4-7b4c-444a-8896-2232df1a9202" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FOKPIqlG0wk&amp;hl=en"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FOKPIqlG0wk&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div></div>  <p><em>     <br />He’s already improving on his broke leg crawling skills.</em>    <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:2d820fad-31b6-4333-86df-1c263e5a0907" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pP280NTzWZI&amp;hl=en"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pP280NTzWZI&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div></div></p>
