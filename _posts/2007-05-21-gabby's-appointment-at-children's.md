<p>We just got back to Fort Smith after Gabby's appointment at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock today.  The growth on her lip is definitely a hemangioma, and the doctor seemed very confident that we can treat it.  We will be returning to Children's next Thursday, May 31 for her first treatment.  The treatment will consist of a shot of cortisone directly in her lip to slow the growth and laser treatment to reduce the redness.  We will go back for 3-5 total treatments every 4-6 weeks through the first year assuming they go well.  Sometime after the first year when the hemangioma has grown to its biggest point, we will evaluate whether or not we want to do surgery to remove what is left of the growth.  The doctor made it sound like a very simple surgery that would completely remove the growth.</p>
<p>We are very grateful that we were able to get into Children's and feel very comfortable with the staff that we have met there so far.  We also are thankful for the support and prayers of all our friends and family.</p>

> Thank you for creating this site and sharing your experience with Gabby's hemangioma. I am now going through what you went through last year. Our daughter Nellie is 2 months old and her hemangioma is very similar to Gabby's. It appeared 1 month ago, like you described and has grown quite a bit since we discovered it on April 1. Your site has been what I need. I must now read on. Thanks again. Julie in Stockholm

> First of all she is a beautiful baby!! That being said I understand what you are going through. I had a hemangioma on my lip growing up as a child. I am so glad to hear that these types of treatments are avaialble at such an early age!( my parents were intructed to wait until the growth and the redness had completely subsided, needless to say I did not have my first surgery until I was 13)I hope that Gabby is doing well, and Im sure she looks even more beautiful now than she did in her last picture:)
