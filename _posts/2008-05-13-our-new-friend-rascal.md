<div>A few days ago, we started seeing a baby rabbit in and around our back yard.  He has evidently decided that our yard will be his home, and we've seen him a few times each day.  Leslie caught a video of him today hopping around on our back porch.  We have enjoyed taking Gabby out and setting out carrots and watching them disappear.  In case you didn't notice in the title of this entry, we have named our new friend Rascal.</div>
