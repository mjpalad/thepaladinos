<p>We just got back to Fort Smith after Gabby's appointment at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock today.  The growth on her lip is definitely a hemangioma, and the doctor seemed very confident that we can treat it.  We will be returning to Children's next Thursday, May 31 for her first treatment.  The treatment will consist of a shot of cortisone directly in her lip to slow the growth and laser treatment to reduce the redness.  We will go back for 3-5 total treatments every 4-6 weeks through the first year assuming they go well.  Sometime after the first year when the hemangioma has grown to its biggest point, we will evaluate whether or not we want to do surgery to remove what is left of the growth.  The doctor made it sound like a very simple surgery that would completely remove the growth.</p>
<p>We are very grateful that we were able to get into Children's and feel very comfortable with the staff that we have met there so far.  We also are thankful for the support and prayers of all our friends and family.</p>
