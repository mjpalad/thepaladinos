<p>I thought this video accurately captured what Peter has been up to while Gabby is in school.&#160; Peter will start PK3 two days a week at Lifeway Christian School tomorrow.&#160; We got Mrs. Ostrand again.&#160; Yea!&#160; That’s who Gabby had 2 years ago.&#160; It’s hard to believe that he’ll be the same age she was when she started there.&#160; She seemed so big at the time but he’s still just my baby. </p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:bb89ff95-e2fc-4f79-9c55-4451dd799e1c" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div><object width="448" height="252"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/T27U92a8AsY?hl=en&amp;hd=1"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/T27U92a8AsY?hl=en&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="448" height="252"></embed></object></div></div>
