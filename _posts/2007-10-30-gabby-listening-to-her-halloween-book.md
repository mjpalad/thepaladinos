> That was precious.  I love to hear kids laugh like that.  I think I enjoyed Gabby laughing as much as she enjoyed your reading her the book.

> Now, Gabby told me in her last e-mail that she didn't really want to wear the duck costume, and here you go!  Didn't she tell you?  Regardless, she still looks adorable!  What a belly laugh!  She certainly is a happy little one.  You can tell she is surrounded by lots of love.  Love to all
