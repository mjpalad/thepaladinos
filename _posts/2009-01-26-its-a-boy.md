title: "IT'S A BOY!"

<p>We had our first official ultrasound today and found out that we're having a boy.&#160; I had a very quick surprise ultrasound last week at the dr's office and thought that it was a boy but it was definitely confirmed today.&#160; He's about 1 lb and they have him due about the same time as our original due date so we'll just say June 1st still.&#160; He was very active and healthy.&#160; We've included a video and pictures.&#160; As you can see his little legs are up by his head so he's quite flexible.&#160; Just in case you can't tell what's what in the video his head is on the right and his heart is in the middle of the screen.&#160; His legs are on the left and they extend up to his head.&#160; Sometimes the screen will switch to a foot or hand shot and when they show his profile you can see his tongue moving and his little mouth opening and closing (I think he's saying Mama).&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby is handling the news well although she has said Sissy a lot today.&#160; We'll just say that she's excited about being a big sister instead of saying that she wants a Sissy.&#160; Sometimes she seems happy about the baby and will pet my belly and sometimes she just says No, No when we say something about the baby.&#160; She'll be a good big Sissy though.&#160; </p>  <p>We're very excited and can't wait to see more of this little guy.&#160; </p>  <p></p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:e5ffa6f2-1cdb-43dc-a815-04d4bb4be104" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">   <div><embed src="http://i170.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid170.photobucket.com/albums/u252/mjpalad/1stultrasound1-26-09.flv" width="448" height="361" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" /></div> </div>  <p></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/I20090126083750796_2.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="266" alt="I20090126083750796" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/I20090126083750796_thumb.jpg" width="353" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p><em>The money shot.&#160; The arrow is pointing at the confirmation that it's a boy, just in case you can't tell.</em><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/I20090126083752578_2.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="266" alt="I20090126083752578" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/I20090126083752578_thumb.jpg" width="353" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p><em>You can see his little foot up on his head.</em>    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/I20090126083753218_2.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="266" alt="I20090126083753218" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/I20090126083753218_thumb.jpg" width="353" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p><em>His arm is extending out and he's pointing to the right here with his little finger.&#160; </em>    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/I20090126083751687_2.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="266" alt="I20090126083751687" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/I20090126083751687_thumb.jpg" width="353" border="0" /></a></p>

I am certain the pancreas is just as sturdy.  What a thrill for us all.  Never thought I could love him this much already.  Look what I've learned from 
Gabby!  I am soo proud of you all!!!  Prayers are being answered one by one.  Love to all
