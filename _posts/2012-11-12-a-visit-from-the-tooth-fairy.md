<p>Last week we had a major first in our house.&#160; Gabby lost her first baby tooth!&#160; She’s had a few teeth loose for awhile and has been told repeatedly by her control crazed mommy not to wiggle them.&#160; I was so not ready for her to hit this milestone and have tried fighting it unsuccessfully.&#160; </p>  <p>Last Wednesday she started crying when it got really loose and she could actually move it with her tongue.&#160; I tried pulling a little but almost blacked out and had to call daddy in.&#160; Seriously!&#160; I had to sit down.&#160; I can be such a girl sometimes!&#160; :)&#160; Anyway, we gave up when she panicked and she decided she wanted to let her teacher pull it the next day at school. </p>  <p>Apparently her teacher is a tooth pulling expert and has done it for other kids in the class.&#160;&#160; We really didn’t want to miss out on that first but we told her that it was ok if the tooth was ready and she couldn’t wait.&#160; </p>  <p>I forgot about it all day and almost burst into tears when I picked her up and she had a big hole in her sweet smile.&#160; Her teacher actually pulled two other girls teeth that day too.&#160; That poor woman has a tough job!&#160; :)</p>  <p>Gabby was very excited the next morning to see that the Tooth Fairy had come to visit her.&#160; We were going to fight that one too and had actually told her before that the Tooth Fairy wasn’t real.&#160; But she really wanted to believe and I thought, heck, let’s have fun with it.&#160; She’s only little once and I’m sure she’ll forgive the “white lie” someday.&#160; </p>  <p>She has a few more that are loose too so I really need to get those family pictures in before she’s singing the “all I want for Christmas is my two front teeth” song.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=Windows-Live-Writer/A-Visit-from-the-Tooth-Fairy/2FB27CC3/toothless.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none;

A tooth receipt, a letter from the Tooth Fairy and $1.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=Windows-Live-Writer/A-Visit-from-the-Tooth-Fairy/1E31F61E/DSC_3554.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none;

This is a rare scene in our house.&#160; </p>
