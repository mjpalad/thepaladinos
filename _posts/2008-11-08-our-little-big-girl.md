<p>Last weekend we took Gabby to the zoo in Tulsa with some friends.  She loved seeing the animals that were actually out or awake and always loves being outside.   We didn't get any pictures with animals but we did get some cute family shots with the beautiful fall foliage.  </p> <p>Also below are Gabby's diva pictures.  Gabby's friend Hannah brought over some dress up shoes, necklace and earrings.  Gabby thought she was very special and big with all of her new accessories on.  </p> <p>Today we went "hiking" at Devil's Den.  Gabby had a good time playing in the leaves and looking at the water.  She wasn't wild about wearing her coat and hat but we worked through that eventually.  Enjoy all the pictures!</p> <p><a href="/assets/images/2008-11-08-P1030434.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="P1030434" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/images/2008-11-08-P1030434_thumb.jpg" style="border-right: 0px;

As I said before,   Number seven has the most beautiful profile...And he is large already, so it seems like he is a big eater like his Dad...Stay well Leslie.  You are doing great, and you make such a great Mom, as Michael makes a great Dad,  and we know Gabby is going to be a great big sister.  Love and kisses to all.
