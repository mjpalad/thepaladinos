<p>
Sorry that we&#39;ve gotten a little behind in our blogging lately.&nbsp; Gabby is now doing all sorts of exciting things.&nbsp; She is getting better and better with her walking and takes a few more steps every day.&nbsp; She likes to climb in chairs that she can reach and then jump out of the chair onto the floor or into Mommy&#39;s lap.&nbsp; She can shut doors now and is desperately trying to reach the door knobs.&nbsp; She makes the funniest babbling noises and is coming up with more and more sounds everyday so we&#39;re assuming she will be saying more words soon.&nbsp; She can now eat dairy products and likes cheese and cottage cheese.&nbsp; But they don&#39;t seem to agree with her tummy so we&#39;re still experimenting with her diet.&nbsp; Gabby is enrolled in Mother&#39;s Day Out one day a week and really seems to be enjoying it now.&nbsp; She doesn&#39;t cry anymore when we leave and actually reached out for one of the workers to take her last week.&nbsp; She is now big enough to sit in a front facing car seat and likes it much better.&nbsp; She talks to herself and apparently likes to tell herself jokes because she just sits in the seat talking and laughing.&nbsp; She&#39;s a happy girl for the most part and keeps us extremely entertained with her funny faces and noises.&nbsp; Enjoy the latest videos!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
