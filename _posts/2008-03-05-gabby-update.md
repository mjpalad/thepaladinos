Sorry that we've gotten a little behind in our blogging lately.  Gabby is now doing all sorts of exciting things.  She is getting better and better with her walking and takes a few more steps every day.  She likes to climb in chairs that she can reach and then jump out of the chair onto the floor or into Mommy's lap.  She can shut doors now and is desperately trying to reach the door knobs.  She makes the funniest babbling noises and is coming up with more and more sounds everyday so we're assuming she will be saying more words soon.  She can now eat dairy products and likes cheese and cottage cheese.  But they don't seem to agree with her tummy so we're still experimenting with her diet.  Gabby is enrolled in Mother's Day Out one day a week and really seems to be enjoying it now.  She doesn't cry anymore when we leave and actually reached out for one of the workers to take her last week.  She is now big enough to sit in a front facing car seat and likes it much better.  She talks to herself and apparently likes to tell herself jokes because she just sits in the seat talking and laughing.  She's a happy girl for the most part and keeps us extremely entertained with her funny faces and noises.  Enjoy the latest videos!
