<p>Tonight we visited Santa at the mall.&#160; Gabby was originally going to stand beside Santa but when she found out that her friend Aubrey sat on his lap she decided she could be brave and do it too.&#160; She and Peter did so well.&#160; He wasn’t thrilled but at least he didn’t scream.&#160; Gabby told Santa her name and how old she was.&#160; She didn’t tell him what she wants for Christmas “because he already knows.”&#160; Santa’s camera broke while we were in line so he read a story to all the kids while we waited.&#160; The flash was still broken later so they let anyone who brought a camera take pictures instead of paying for one and of course we just happened to have our big ole camera.&#160; </p>  <p>Santa’s coming early to our house (tonight) and Gabby is beyond excited to wake up to presents in the morning.&#160; And Santa is excited about the cookies that are left out for him.&#160; We hope everyone has a very Merry Christmas!</p>  <p><em>Listening to Santa read Twas the Night Before Christmas.</em>    <br /><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0061.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_0061" border="0" alt="DSC_0061" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0061_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0062.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_0062" border="0" alt="DSC_0062" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0062_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0069.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_0069" border="0" alt="DSC_0069" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0069_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0072a.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_0072a" border="0" alt="DSC_0072a" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0072a_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="290" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0074.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DSC_0074" border="0" alt="DSC_0074" src="/thepaladinos/assets/images/2010-12-23-DSC_0074_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="270" /></a></p>
