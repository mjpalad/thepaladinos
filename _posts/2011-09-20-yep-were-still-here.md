<p>Yes, we are still alive and no, I haven’t forgotten we have a blog…we’ve just been a little busy with our Fall schedule kicking back in and ok, I’ll say it…I can be a little lazy sometimes.&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby and Peter both started back to school in mid August and are now going to the same school on Monday’s and Wednesday’s.&#160; Can you guess which days of the week are my favorite now?&#160; Not to say I don’t enjoy my time with the kids too but it is nice to be able to get a few things done without them.&#160; Gabby loves her class and has a new friend that she adores.&#160; Peter still isn’t sold on his class and cries every morning but the teacher says that he has a good day and he’s always happy when I pick him up.&#160; His comments are, “Mommy, eat all my runch (or lunch if you don’t speak Peter)” and “pay wif twucks.”&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby has also started soccer which has been highly entertaining for all of us.&#160; She loves her coaches and soccer friends and she plays really…umm, let’s just say she’s there and she’s happy.&#160; Yesterday was our first game and she was very excited and a little nervous.&#160; Michael and I were nervous too.&#160; We couldn’t sit still and just kind of paced the field.&#160; When she went in she started as a goalie and luckily the other girls on her team are animals and wouldn’t even let the ball near the other teams goal.&#160; Seriously, they should start recruiting in the 4-5 year old teams for college.&#160; These girls are good!&#160; Then they let her run the field (don’t know if that’s the right terminology but you get the idea).&#160; She walked after the ball and sometimes skipped, she waved hi to us, she tried to hug her other team mates and I think she even sat down at one point.&#160; Keep in mind, this is while she was in the game and supposed to be playing.&#160; So we had a little pep talk with her mid way through the game and boy did it work, I said “Take that great attitude and run after the ball as fast as you can.”&#160; She said “ok” and that’s exactly what she did.&#160; She ran as fast as we’ve ever seen her run straight for that ball but unfortunately it was in the middle of the game and she wasn’t playing.&#160; There was no slowing her down and Michael had to run out and bring her back.&#160; It was one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen but then she saw that other people were laughing and got really upset.&#160; Poor Gabby!&#160; She was just doing what I told her to do.&#160; But after a little break and a lot of hugs she got back on that field and really tried to get the ball.&#160; We’re so proud of our little Cyclone!&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=Windows-Live-Writer/5a779a603c51/1139D8FC/IMG_0542.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none;

This is a shark from Chuck E Cheese in a princess dress.&#160; Gabby cut the fins off the shark to help him fit in the dress, then cried when she didn’t like it but it turned out okay because he does fit in the dress better now.&#160; :)&#160; Only from the mind of a 4 year old.&#160; </p>
