We're now down to 2 weeks until Gabby's due date.  At my doctor's appointment yesterday I was dilated to 1 cm so we're having a little bit of action.  No contractions, etc yet and I feel about as well as can be expected at this stage.  It's getting a little uncomfortable with this active baby running out of room.  We're very anxious to meet her.
