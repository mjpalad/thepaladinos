<p>Gabby turned one month old today and celebrated with a visit from her great-grandparents and great aunt and uncle.  She is weighing in at around 9 lbs 3 oz, but we're not real certain about that because the scale actually weighed her at 10 lbs at one point.  Regardless, she's gaining weight well and seems to be a healthy girl.</p>
<p>Here are more of the faces of Gabby for your enjoyment:</p>
