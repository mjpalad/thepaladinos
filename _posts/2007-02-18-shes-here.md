<p>Gabby has arrived!  She was born yesterday, February 17, 2007 at 3:07 PM.  She weighs 7 lbs 6 oz and is 20 3/4 inches long.  She has a head full of long light to dark brown hair and most importantly is healthy.  Leslie is doing great as well and had about as easy a delivery as could be expected.  We thank God for Gabby and her safe arrival.</p>
<p>Leslie's water broke about 11:40 PM Friday night.  We went into the hospital shortly thereafter, and she started having mild contractions about 3:30 AM Saturday morning.  The nurses administered Pitocin around 9:30ish Saturday morning and the heavy contractions began.  Later after about an hour of pushing, Gabby was delivered at 3:07 PM.</p>
<p>We thank everyone for the prayers and support and look forward to you all meeting our new little one.</p>
