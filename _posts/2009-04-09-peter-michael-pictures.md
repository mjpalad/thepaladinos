If you didn&rsquo;t know we have definitely decided on the name Peter Michael Paladino.&nbsp; You can judge for yourself if you think the name fits since I had my 4-D ultrasound today.&nbsp; Unfortunately Peter Michael wasn&rsquo;t feeling cooperative and was sleeping soundly, but we did get half a shot of his face.&nbsp; The other side is covered up with placenta.&nbsp; Also, with his position there was no confirmation that he really is a Peter Michael but we&rsquo;re pretty sure from the previous ultrasound that&rsquo;s what we have.&nbsp; And I just think he looks like a boy.&nbsp; There is a little bit of hair from what she could tell and it looks like he has big, full lips like his sister.&nbsp; His little face is literally about a centimeter from the outside of my stomach so the poor little guy doesn&rsquo;t have much room.&nbsp; I guess that means I just need to work on gaining a lot more weight.&nbsp; Yea, I can have donettes again!&nbsp; I think he&rsquo;s going to be a talker like his sister because he opened and closed his mouth a lot.&nbsp; He was probably telling us to stop poking his face.&nbsp; 
</p>

Just to update you on his progress otherwise, I am 32 weeks and feeling pretty good.&nbsp; Peter Michael is pretty still as long as I&rsquo;m up and moving about but as soon as I sit down to relax he gets very active.&nbsp; With Gabby it was mostly kicks and hits but with Peter it&rsquo;s more like full body movement back and forth.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very strange when you can see rolls and jumps through my clothes.&nbsp; Like his sister, he loves our pastor&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; Or maybe he hates it but either way he gets very active on Sunday mornings and I&rsquo;m sure gives the people around me a show.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re planning on delivering in Bentonville since we&rsquo;ll hopefully be moved when he comes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
