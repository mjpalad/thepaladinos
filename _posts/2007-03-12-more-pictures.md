<p>It's amazing to see how different Gabby can look depending on the angle or just how she's turned.  Luckily, it seems that she's taking after her mom so far, so all her different looks are absolutely beautiful.  We're certainly enjoying her now but look forward to watching her grow up as well.</p>

> My lil baby girl is 13mth and developed her SB at 2wks old on her top right lip. Very distressing when people say they feel sorry for her, when all I see is my beautiful baby girl, its not even that big, size of the nail on my little finger but raised up. I've also been asked if she has a cleft lip, cheeky things, its no-ones business but mine! Why are people so cruel. I've decided to wait to see if it will go of its own accord
