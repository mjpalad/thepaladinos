<p>It's amazing to see how different Gabby can look depending on the angle or just how she's turned.  Luckily, it seems that she's taking after her mom so far, so all her different looks are absolutely beautiful.  We're certainly enjoying her now but look forward to watching her grow up as well.</p>
