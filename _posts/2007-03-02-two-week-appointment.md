Gabby had her two week checkup with the pediatrician today.  She was healthy and was up to 7 lbs 6 1/2 oz which is a 1/2 oz more than her birth weight.  The doctor and mom and dad were very happy with this as she gained about 1 1/2 oz per day since her last appointment.  Our next appointment will be at two months, and we're hoping it will be just as encouraging.
