<p>Well, we're 2.5 weeks down and counting since Peter Michael's arrival.&#160; The first week Michael's mom, Debby (a.k.a. GranDeb), stayed with us which was a huge help with meals and grandkids.&#160; Thank you GranDeb!&#160; I don't know what we would have done without her.&#160; This last week was the first time for me to be alone with both kids which went surprisingly well.&#160; </p>  <p>We have already fallen into a little routine and for the most part it's manageable.&#160; Peter Michael has been doing pretty well at night.&#160; There were a few nights that had me excited when he went around 4 hours between feedings.&#160; But now he seems to have settled into a pretty rigid 3 hour feeding schedule day or night.&#160; But it still works out to about one feeding a night, or at least in the middle of the night which isn't too bad.&#160; Peter usually stays awake after his morning feeding until 11:00 or 12:00 which has been interesting.&#160; He's a very easy baby as long as you hold him while he's awake.&#160; So it makes it a little difficult to get anything done in the morning but I shouldn't complain since he sleeps most of the rest of the day.&#160; </p>  <p>Gabby continues to do very well in her role as big sister.&#160; She loves running errands for mommy when I'm feeding or holding Peter Michael.&#160; Sometimes she gets a little whiny and wants to be picked up or held when we're holding the baby but she doesn't seem to resent him at all thank goodness.&#160; She has been a very loving big sister and asks to hold him or give him his paci.&#160; </p>  <p>This last weekend was a very big one for us with two big outings with the kids.&#160; I know, we're probably crazy to take a newborn out this early but he stays in his carrier and sleeps for the most part so he wasn't exposed to too much.&#160; Saturday we went to the Gentry Zoo.&#160; It has a drive thru and a petting zoo with all kinds of animals.&#160; Gabby got to pet goats, donkeys, a zebra, a kangaroo, baby raccoons, baby pigs, turtles, deer, and hedgehogs.&#160; We were very surprised by all the animals that they have.&#160; We also went out to eat for the first time Saturday night which went very well.&#160; Sunday evening we went to a Firefly Festival in Fayetteville at the Botanical Gardens.&#160; It was pretty hot but fun.&#160; We got to see all kinds of interesting people and the grounds there are beautiful.&#160; Both kids were pretty worn out today after their big weekend but I guess we proved that life does go on after having two kids.&#160; </p>
