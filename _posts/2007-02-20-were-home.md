<p>We were released from the hospital about 3:30 PM yesterday (Monday) afternoon.  We are home and all adapting to our new lives.  Seems like we do a lot of swaddling, cuddling, and feeding (mostly feeding for Leslie), but we're getting the hang of it.  Gabby is a little jaundiced and so we're having to supplement with formula for a few days until that gets worked out.  Other than that, everything is great.</p>
<p>Ellie has unexpectedly been wonderful and seems to be adapting well.</p>
