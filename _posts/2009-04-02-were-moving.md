<p>Yea!&nbsp; It's confirmed, we're officially moving to Bentonville.&nbsp; And it only took us 5 months to get it done.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Thank you to everyone who has had to put up with us talking about this for months and months.&nbsp; I'm sure you're all just sick of us.&nbsp; </p> <p>We accepted an offer on our house last week.&nbsp; By the way, if you ever need a realtor we love <a href="http://www.kingrealtygroup.net/index.php?q=profile&amp;uid=17" target="_blank">Linda Geraghty</a> with <a href="http://www.kingrealtygroup.net/index.php?q=profile&amp;uid=17" target="_blank">King Realty Group</a>.&nbsp; We were For Sale By Owner for 2 months and finally listed it with Linda and sold within 7 days.&nbsp; And we just went into contract on a new house in Bentonville today.&nbsp; We love the new house (we think any way since we've only been through it once).&nbsp; </p> <p>We will be closing on both houses on April 30th.&nbsp; It's been a very long process but we are so thankful and thrilled with how it has all worked out.&nbsp; God has definitely provided for us.&nbsp; We will really miss everyone in Fort Smith and are sorry to leave our house behind.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see what Miss Gabby thinks about having a new house, new room and new baby brother all at once.&nbsp; I guess as long as she still has a bed to jump on and her dance video (thanks again Aunt Patty) she'll be okay.&nbsp; </p> <p><em>This is a pic of our new digs.&nbsp; </em><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/WereMoving_125A1/house_2.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="199" alt="house" src="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/WereMoving_125A1/house_thumb.jpg" width="354" border="0"></a></p>

> Congrats on your move! I'm really happy for you guys that it all happened really quickly. Our house has been for sale in BV for 10 months now and we're still having to rent in SDale until we can sell it. Very frustrating, but we know God called us here and we know it will happen sooner or later. Maybe I'll see you around sometime since you'll be in this direction! Hope your labor and delivery go great with your new little boy!
