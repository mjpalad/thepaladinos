<p>Yea!&nbsp; It's confirmed, we're officially moving to Bentonville.&nbsp; And it only took us 5 months to get it done.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Thank you to everyone who has had to put up with us talking about this for months and months.&nbsp; I'm sure you're all just sick of us.&nbsp; </p> <p>We accepted an offer on our house last week.&nbsp; By the way, if you ever need a realtor we love <a href="http://www.kingrealtygroup.net/index.php?q=profile&amp;uid=17" target="_blank">Linda Geraghty</a> with <a href="http://www.kingrealtygroup.net/index.php?q=profile&amp;uid=17" target="_blank">King Realty Group</a>.&nbsp; We were For Sale By Owner for 2 months and finally listed it with Linda and sold within 7 days.&nbsp; And we just went into contract on a new house in Bentonville today.&nbsp; We love the new house (we think any way since we've only been through it once).&nbsp; </p> <p>We will be closing on both houses on April 30th.&nbsp; It's been a very long process but we are so thankful and thrilled with how it has all worked out.&nbsp; God has definitely provided for us.&nbsp; We will really miss everyone in Fort Smith and are sorry to leave our house behind.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see what Miss Gabby thinks about having a new house, new room and new baby brother all at once.&nbsp; I guess as long as she still has a bed to jump on and her dance video (thanks again Aunt Patty) she'll be okay.&nbsp; </p> <p><em>This is a pic of our new digs.&nbsp; </em><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/WereMoving_125A1/house_2.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="199" alt="house" src="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=WindowsLiveWriter/WereMoving_125A1/house_thumb.jpg" width="354" border="0"></a></p>
