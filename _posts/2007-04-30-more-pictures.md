> My lil baby girl is 13mth and developed her SB at 2wks old on her top right lip. Very distressing when people say they feel sorry for her, when all I see is my beautiful baby girl, its not even that big, size of the nail on my little finger but raised up. I've also been asked if she has a cleft lip, cheeky things, its no-ones business but mine! Why are people so cruel. I've decided to wait to see if it will go of its own accord
