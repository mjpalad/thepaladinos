<p>This is how Gabby dances right now.  Probably not the healthiest thing but she seems to like it.  She has been very vocal the last couple of days and yesterday said blueberry for the first time.  It came out "blahb" the first time but by the second or third time she had it down to "booberry".  She got upset at one point and wanted mommy to pick her up so she started just throwing out words she knew and came up with "booberry, meme, mama" said in this cute little crying voice.  She'll be calling you all on the phone to talk in no time.    </p>
