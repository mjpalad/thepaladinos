title: "Gabby's Weekend"

<p>This weekend Papa Dino came to visit and we had such a good time.  Saturday we watched the air show which was a first for us all.  Gabby was pretty impressed with the big jets even though mommy had to hold her ears sometimes because they got so loud.  However, we realized that it is going to take a lot to entertain her because she completely ignored 8 - WW2 planes who flew overhead for a 10 minute show where they repeatedly "bombed" the air base.  She was much more entertained with Mommy's wallet at that point and only looked up a couple of times to see what all the fuss was about.  After a nice nap at home Papa Dino took Gabby to buy her very own play house.  She loves it and goes in and out the door over and over.  Finally a door she can open and close all by herself!  </p>
