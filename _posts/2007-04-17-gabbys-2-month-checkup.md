title: "Gabby's 2 Month Checkup"

<p>Gabby had her 2 month checkup on Tuesday and is doing great.  She is 23 1/4 inches long and 11 lbs. 9 oz. which puts her in the 90th percentile on length and 80th percentile on weight.  Woo hoo!  She had a little bit of diaper rash, but that has mostly cleared up in the last couple of days.</p>
<p>Until now, Gabby has only been waking up once a night to feed and usually goes back down pretty easily.  We are now trying to wean her off that feeding and get her to sleep through the night.  The books say that around 2 months is when they can start sleeping through, so we'll see how that goes.</p>
