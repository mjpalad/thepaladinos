<p>I took this video of Peter today.&#160; He makes all kinds of interesting noises now.&#160; One day I actually had to move to the loud side of Wal-mart because he was making his noises loud enough to hear them echo.&#160; That’s right, he’s too loud for Wal-mart.&#160; I guess he’s starting to pick up some things from his sister.&#160; :)</p>  <p>Just to give an update of where the kids are at the moment.&#160; Gabby has been doing okay with her potty training.&#160; She goes no. 1 really well but we’re still working on no. 2.&#160; I can go into more detail on that but it’s probably more than you want to hear.&#160; She still enjoys singing around the house, painting and playing with her princesses.&#160; Peter Michael sits up by himself pretty well and is now ready to crawl.&#160; Or at least he wants to crawl but his body is not cooperating.&#160; He sits up and rocks forward but just lands on his tummy and gets upset.&#160; That’s ok though, I’m not really looking forward to his mobility.&#160; He’s eating his baby food well now and I tried a couple of puffs today for the first time.&#160; He ate them but wasn’t as into them as I thought he would be.&#160; He’s still sleeping well for the most part.&#160; We think that he can say Dadda, Bubba and Momma and actually knows what they mean.&#160; </p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:c7fb5520-8eb5-4546-a6b5-49a7ebe26412" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div><iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3MsG_1Te40Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
