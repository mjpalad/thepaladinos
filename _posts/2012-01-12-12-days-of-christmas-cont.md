<p>I’m horrible about finishing things go so I kind of dropped off on my 12 Days of Christmas updates.&#160; And now that it’s the 11th of January I guess I should probably finish the story.&#160; :)&#160; </p>  <p>Our sweet mystery friends continued their gifts right up until the 11th night.&#160; We left them a few notes on the door along the way saying thank you and telling them that we would be out of town on the 12th night and would miss what we hoped would be “the big reveal” so we could find out who they were.&#160; Also in a note we invited them to dinner so we could meet and formally thank them for all of the blessings.&#160; After a few back and forth notes we settled a date and we have since finally met them.&#160; It was the Saumweber family.&#160; Michael and Joe work together and we’ve all gotten to be friends.&#160; They have 3 adorable children and I don’t know how they got them loaded up EVERY NIGHT to bring us our gifts!&#160; It was such a fun addition to our Christmas this year and really made a sweet memory for us.&#160; Maybe we can pass the blessing on next year. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=Windows-Live-Writer/12-Days-of-Christmas-Cont/560EC5DA/Saumwebers.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Saumwebers" border="0" alt="Saumwebers" src="http://www.thepaladinos.com/image.axd?picture=Windows-Live-Writer/12-Days-of-Christmas-Cont/39452AF8/Saumwebers_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="271" /></a>&#160; <br />The Saumweber Family.
