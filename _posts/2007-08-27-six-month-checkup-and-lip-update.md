title: "Six-Month Checkup and Lip Update"
date: 2007-08-27

<p>Gabby's had her six-month checkup with the pediatrician last week and is doing great.  She was 27 3/4 inches long which puts her in the 95th percentile.  Weight was 15 pounds 11 ounces which puts her about average.  So far it seems like she'll be tall and thin.  We'll see how that progresses.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, we have started Gabby on rice cereal and oatmeal and are just getting into fruits.  It took some coaxing at first, but she seems to enjoy eating her grown-up food now.</p>
<p>As far as her lip goes, we haven't provided any updates because there really hasn't been any news in that area.  Her last appointment was back in the latter part of June, and since then it has really reduced in size and redness to the point that we felt like going back for our monthly appointments was overkill.  Within the last week or so though there seems to be a small amount of swelling, so Leslie is going to go ahead and go back this Thursday to have it checked out.  We're hoping and praying that the treatments will keep it down enough that we won't end up having to have surgery on it when it's done growing.</p>
