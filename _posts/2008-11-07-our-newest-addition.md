I think just about everyone knows by now but just in case not, we&#39;ll be adding a new member to our family next year.&nbsp; I will be 11 weeks pregnant on Monday and our due date is June 1st.&nbsp; So far I definitely feel and look pregnant.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been nauseous off and on and feel pretty tired and hungry most of the time.&nbsp; But hopefully that will pass soon.&nbsp; Gabby looks pretty confused when we try to tell her there&#39;s a baby in mommy&#39;s tummy so I guess we&#39;ll have to keep working on that.&nbsp;

We had our first doctor&#39;s appointment and ultrasound last week.&nbsp; The baby has a good heartbeat and was sleeping soundly (maybe this will be a relaxed baby).&nbsp; The ultrasound photo is below.&nbsp; The baby&#39;s head is on the right and you can kind of make out little arms and legs on the left.&nbsp; We&#39;re very excited and can&#39;t wait to find out what we&#39;re having and to meet our little baby.
